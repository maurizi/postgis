Creating a development environment with Vagrant
===============================================

Vagrant (http://vagrantup.com) is a tool for automating the creation and provisioning of virtual machines.

The Vagrantfile at the root of the repository defines a multi-machine setup, to allow for easily testing on different platforms.

To start a VM for a specific operating system, you must run ``vagrant up <os name>``.

Currently the supported operating systems are:
* ``ubuntu-precise``
* ``ubuntu-trusty``
* ``centos-7``
